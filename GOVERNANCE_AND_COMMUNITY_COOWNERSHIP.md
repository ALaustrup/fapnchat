# WYA!? — Governance & community co-ownership models

## Governance philosophy

**WYA!? is not owned over its users.**  
**It is stewarded with them.**

Governance exists to:

- Prevent power concentration
- Preserve culture at scale
- Make legitimacy visible
- Keep decisions reversible

**Governance is not democracy theater.**  
**It is constrained authority with accountability.**

---

## 1. Power separation model

WYA!? governance is split into four independent powers that check each other.

- **Platform Operators** (Execution)
- **Community Stewards** (Culture)
- **Safety & Ethics Council** (Protection)
- **Users** (Consent & Legitimacy)

**No group can act unilaterally on critical decisions.**

---

## 2. Platform Operators (staff)

### Role

- Build and operate infrastructure
- Maintain uptime and performance
- Implement policy decisions
- Execute emergency responses

### Limits

- Cannot unilaterally change safety rules
- Cannot override moderation outcomes
- Cannot access private content without cause
- Cannot suppress governance processes

### Accountability

- Actions logged
- Decisions reviewable
- Subject to council review
- Removable for violations

**Operators execute. They do not rule.**

## 3. Community Stewards (elected)

### Who they are

- Long-term, high-trust users
- Diverse geography, age layers, identities
- Elected by peers within eligibility bands

### What they do

- Represent community concerns
- Shape cultural norms
- Review policy proposals
- Escalate systemic issues

### What they cannot do

- Moderate individual cases
- Access private user data
- Enforce bans
- Monetize their role

### Term limits

- Fixed terms
- Staggered rotation
- Mandatory cooldown before re-election

**Stewards protect culture, not power.**

---

## 4. Safety & Ethics Council (independent)

### Composition

- Child safety experts
- Digital rights experts
- Moderation professionals
- Trauma-informed reviewers

### Authority

- Veto unsafe features
- Freeze rollouts
- Review major incidents
- Override operator decisions in safety matters

### Independence

- Cannot be employees
- Cannot be monetarily incentivized
- Funded but not controlled by WYA!?

**If growth conflicts with safety, the council wins.**

## 5. User consent mechanisms

Consent is active, not assumed.

Users can:

- Vote on major platform changes
- Trigger reviews of controversial decisions
- Propose amendments
- Call for steward recall

Voting is:

- Transparent
- Logged
- Auditable
- Scoped (not every decision, only impact-heavy ones)

---

## 6. Co-ownership without financialization

WYA!? does not tokenize governance.

Instead:

- Reputation-based voting weight (non-transferable)
- Contribution history matters
- Time and trust, not money, grant influence

**No governance NFTs.**  
**No speculation.**  
**No whales.**

---

## 7. Policy change lifecycle

1. Proposal published
2. Community comment period
3. Steward review
4. Safety council assessment
5. Operator feasibility review
6. Final decision with rationale
7. Public changelog

**Emergency changes bypass steps temporarily but must be retroactively reviewed.**

---

## 8. Transparency guarantees

Published regularly:

- Moderation statistics
- Appeal outcomes
- Safety interventions
- Data requests
- Governance votes

**Opacity is treated as a failure condition.**

---

## 9. Governance failure conditions

Governance is considered broken if:

- Decisions become irreversible
- Dissent is punished
- Feedback loops close
- Safety concerns are ignored
- Trust metrics collapse

**At that point, emergency governance reset procedures trigger.**
