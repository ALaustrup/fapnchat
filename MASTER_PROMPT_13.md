---

## Requirements

### Core Constraints

1. **Navigation must feel like moving between spaces**
   - Not clicking between pages
   - Not switching between views
   - Actual movement through a world

2. **No traditional "feed"**
   - No infinite scroll

4. **Presence-driven navigation**
   - "Who's here" influences where you go
   - Co-presence creates relevance
   - Presence is primary, content is secondary

5. **Intentional discovery**
   - Not overwhelming
   - Not algorithmic
   - User-driven, not system-driven

6. **Always know "where you are"**
   - Spatial context always visible
   - Clear sense of location

## Define

### 1. What Users See When They First Arrive

#### **The Arrival Experience**

**Not**: A dashboard, feed, or landing page

**Instead**: **Your Home Space**

- **Personal room/space** that belongs to the user
- **Customizable** background, music, widgets
- **Presence indicators** showing who's nearby or visiting
- **Recent activity** (bounded, intentional, not infinite)
- **Invitations** to join rooms or chats
- **Navigation hub** to other spaces

**Key Principles**:
- Feels like arriving home, not logging into a tool
- Personal space, not public feed
- Presence-aware, not content-focused
- Bounded content, not infinite scroll

#### **First-Time User Experience**

**Onboarding Flow**:
1. **Create your space** (profile customization)
2. **Choose your starting room** (discover a room to join)
3. **Meet someone** (intentional connection, not algorithmic)
4. **Learn navigation** (spatial movement tutorial)

**Not**: Account setup → Feed → Algorithmic suggestions

**Instead**: Space creation → Room discovery → Intentional connection → Navigation mastery

---

### 2. How Users Move Between Rooms, Chats, Profiles

#### **Spatial Navigation Model**

**Movement Types**:

1. **Entering a Room**
   - Visual transition: Door opening, space expanding
   - Presence update: "You entered [Room Name]"
   - Context shift: Room becomes active space
   - Co-presence: See who's already there

2. **Leaving a Room**
   - Visual transition: Door closing, space contracting
   - Presence update: "You left [Room Name]"
   - Context shift: Return to previous space
   - Co-presence: Presence removed from room

3. **Opening a Chat**
   - Visual transition: Chat window appears in space
   - Presence update: "Chatting with [User]"
   - Context shift: Chat becomes active, room becomes background
   - Co-presence: See typing, reading, speaking indicators

4. **Visiting a Profile**
   - Visual transition: Entering someone's personal space
   - Presence update: "Visiting [User]'s space"
   - Context shift: Their space becomes active
   - Co-presence: See if they're present, who else is visiting

#### **Navigation Controls**

**Primary Navigation**:
- **Home Space** (your personal room)
- **Active Rooms** (rooms you're currently in)
- **Active Chats** (conversations you're having)
- **Nearby Spaces** (profiles/spaces of people nearby)

**Secondary Navigation**:
- **Room Discovery** (intentional, not algorithmic)
- **Profile Discovery** (presence-driven, not metric-driven)
- **Chat History** (bounded, chronological)

**Not**: Top nav bar, sidebar menu, breadcrumbs

**Instead**: Spatial navigation, presence indicators, room/chat docks

---

### 3. How Proximity and Presence Influence Navigation

#### **Presence-Driven Discovery**

**Proximity Layers**:

1. **Immediate Presence** (same room/space)
   - Highest priority in navigation
   - Always visible
   - Can interact directly

2. **Nearby Presence** (adjacent rooms/spaces)
   - Visible in navigation
   - Can see activity
   - Can join easily

3. **Distant Presence** (other rooms/spaces)
   - Visible in discovery
   - Can see activity
   - Requires intentional navigation

4. **Offline/Inactive** (not present)
   - Lower priority
   - Still discoverable
   - Can leave messages

#### **Presence Indicators in Navigation**

**Visual Cues**:
- **Glow intensity** = proximity/presence strength
- **Pulse animation** = active presence
- **Color coding** = presence type (online, typing, speaking)
- **Size** = relevance/importance

**Navigation Behavior**:
- **Presence attracts** = nearby presence draws attention
- **Presence guides** = presence influences discovery order
- **Presence creates context** = who's present defines space meaning

#### **Co-Presence Creates Relevance**

**Relevance Factors**:
1. **Who's here** (immediate co-presence)
2. **Who's nearby** (adjacent presence)
3. **Who you know** (friend presence)
4. **What's happening** (activity presence)

**Not**: Algorithmic relevance, metric-based relevance

**Instead**: Presence-based relevance, co-presence creates meaning

---

### 4. How Discovery Feels Intentional, Not Overwhelming

#### **Discovery Principles**

**Bounded Discovery**:
- **Limited options** at any time (not infinite)
- **Clear categories** (rooms, profiles, chats)
- **Presence-filtered** (show what's relevant to presence)
- **User-controlled** (user initiates discovery)

**Intentional Discovery**:
- **Search** (user knows what they're looking for)
- **Browse** (user explores intentionally)
- **Follow presence** (user follows who's where)
- **Join invitations** (user accepts invitations)

**Not**: Algorithmic suggestions, infinite recommendations, passive discovery

**Instead**: Intentional exploration, presence-guided discovery, user-controlled

#### **Discovery UI Patterns**

**Room Discovery**:
- **Room list** (bounded, presence-ordered)
- **Room search** (intentional search)
- **Room categories** (user-selected filters)
- **Room invitations** (explicit invitations)

**Profile Discovery**:
- **Nearby profiles** (presence-based)
- **Profile search** (intentional search)
- **Friend connections** (explicit connections)
- **Profile visits** (who visited your space)

**Chat Discovery**:
- **Active chats** (chats you're in)
- **Chat history** (bounded, chronological)
- **Chat invitations** (explicit invitations)
- **Chat search** (intentional search)

### 5. How Users Always Know "Where They Are"

#### **Spatial Context Indicators**

**Always Visible**:
- **Current space name** (where you are)
- **Presence indicator** (who's here with you)
- **Navigation breadcrumb** (how you got here)
- **Return path** (how to get back)

**Context Layers**:
1. **Immediate context** (current room/chat/profile)
2. **Parent context** (what space contains this)
3. **Sibling context** (other spaces at same level)
4. **Home context** (your personal space)

#### **Spatial Awareness**

**Visual Cues**:
- **Background changes** = different spaces have different backgrounds
- **Presence changes** = different spaces have different presence
- **Navigation changes** = different spaces have different navigation
- **Sound changes** = different spaces have different ambient sounds

**State Persistence**:
- **Remember where you were** = return to same space
- **Remember what you were doing** = restore context
- **Remember who was there** = restore presence

**Not**: URL-based navigation, page-based navigation, stateless navigation

**Instead**: Spatial navigation, stateful navigation, presence-aware navigation

## Output Requirements

### World Structure Map

1. **Space Hierarchy**
   - Home Space (personal)
   - Rooms (shared spaces)
   - Chats (conversation spaces)
   - Profiles (personal spaces)

2. **Navigation Patterns**
   - How to move between spaces
   - How presence influences movement
   - How discovery works
   - How context is maintained

3. **Presence Integration**
   - How presence affects navigation
   - How co-presence creates relevance
   - How proximity influences discovery

4. **Discovery Mechanisms**
   - Intentional discovery patterns
   - Bounded discovery limits
   - User-controlled exploration

5. **Spatial Awareness**
   - How users know where they are
   - How context is preserved
   - How navigation feels like movement

---

## Brand DNA Alignment

Every navigation decision must align with:

1. **Immersion over scrolling** → Bounded, intentional navigation
2. **Profile as personal space** → Profiles are spaces, not pages
3. **Presence over performance** → Presence drives navigation
4. **Anti-algorithm philosophy** → User-controlled discovery
5. **Room / space metaphor** → Navigation feels like movement

---

## Success Criteria

The navigation system is successful when:

- ✅ Users feel like they're moving through a world, not clicking pages
- ✅ Presence influences where users go naturally
- ✅ Discovery feels intentional, not overwhelming
- ✅ Users always know where they are spatially
- ✅ Navigation preserves the "place" feeling
- ✅ No infinite feeds or algorithmic trance
- ✅ No dashboard or tool-like interfaces

---

**CRITICAL**: This navigation system must feel like a **persistent, expressive social environment**, not a social network, dating app, or chat app. It must feel closer to early Habbo/IMVU in spirit, AIM/MySpace emotionally, than anything mainstream today.
