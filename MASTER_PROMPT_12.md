# MASTER CURSOR PROMPT 12
## EXPERIENCE PRINCIPLES → PRODUCT RULES

**SYSTEM MODE**: PRODUCT GOVERNANCE ARCHITECT

You are enforcing the WYA!? Brand Philosophy & Experience DNA as hard product rules.

---

## Input

- Full "Brand philosophy & experience DNA" document
- Product Governance Framework (non-negotiables)
- All previous interaction system specifications

---

## Task

Translate emotional pillars and experience principles into explicit product rules and constraints that prevent feature creep and brand dilution.

---

## Define

### 1. What the Product MUST ALWAYS Do

#### **Immersion Over Scrolling**
- **ALWAYS**: Provide bounded, intentional content views
- **ALWAYS**: Require explicit user action to load more content
- **ALWAYS**: Show clear boundaries and endpoints
- **ALWAYS**: Prioritize depth over breadth in content presentation
- **ALWAYS**: Make scrolling feel intentional, not automatic

#### **Profile as Personal Space**
- **ALWAYS**: Allow deep customization of profiles
- **ALWAYS**: Support personal expression over polish
- **ALWAYS**: Let profiles evolve organically over time
- **ALWAYS**: Treat profiles as spaces users inhabit, not summaries they present
- **ALWAYS**: Preserve user's creative choices, never override them

#### **Presence Over Performance**
- **ALWAYS**: Show real-time presence as primary data
- **ALWAYS**: Prioritize "who's here now" over "who's popular"
- **ALWAYS**: Make presence visible and meaningful
- **ALWAYS**: Use presence to drive discovery, not metrics
- **ALWAYS**: Treat presence as connection, not competition

#### **Anti-Algorithm Philosophy**
- **ALWAYS**: Default to chronological order
- **ALWAYS**: Make algorithmic suggestions opt-in
- **ALWAYS**: Explain why suggestions were made
- **ALWAYS**: Allow users to override algorithmic ordering
- **ALWAYS**: Preserve user intent over algorithmic optimization

#### **Room / Space Metaphor**
- **ALWAYS**: Make navigation feel like movement between spaces
- **ALWAYS**: Maintain spatial context in UI
- **ALWAYS**: Use stateful, persistent UI patterns
- **ALWAYS**: Make features feel like places, not tools
- **ALWAYS**: Preserve context across navigation

#### **Never Profile Uniformity**
- **NEVER**: Force standardized profile templates
- **NEVER**: Optimize for "best self" presentation
- **NEVER**: Remove customization options
- **NEVER**: Prioritize polish over personality
- **NEVER**: Make profiles feel like resumes

#### **Never Metric-Driven Behavior**
- **NEVER**: Use metrics as status weapons
- **NEVER**: Create leaderboards or rankings
- **NEVER**: Make metrics primary navigation
- **NEVER**: Drive behavior through metric pressure
- **NEVER**: Prioritize performance over presence

#### **Never Algorithmic Dictatorship**
- **NEVER**: Override user intent with algorithms
- **NEVER**: Hide chronology without consent
- **NEVER**: Replace human choice with algorithmic choice
- **NEVER**: Make algorithmic filtering default
- **NEVER**: Hide why suggestions were made

#### **Never Tool/Dashboard Feel**
- **NEVER**: Create stateless, tool-like interfaces
- **NEVER**: Use dashboard-style layouts
- **NEVER**: Make features feel like content machines
- **NEVER**: Remove spatial context from UI
- **NEVER**: Prioritize efficiency over immersion

### 3. Acceptable Tradeoffs

#### **Performance vs. Presence**
- ✅ **Acceptable**: Slight latency in presence updates for better accuracy
- ✅ **Acceptable**: More server resources for real-time presence
- ✅ **Acceptable**: Slower initial load for richer presence data
- ❌ **Not Acceptable**: Caching presence data that becomes stale
- ❌ **Not Acceptable**: Reducing presence updates to improve performance

#### **Customization vs. Safety**
- ✅ **Acceptable**: Age-gated customization options
- ✅ **Acceptable**: Content moderation overriding customization
- ✅ **Acceptable**: Safety filters that don't remove customization
- ❌ **Not Acceptable**: Removing customization for all users due to safety concerns
- ❌ **Not Acceptable**: Standardizing profiles for safety

#### **Chronological vs. Algorithmic**
- ✅ **Acceptable**: Algorithmic suggestions as opt-in enhancement
- ✅ **Acceptable**: Chronological default with algorithmic overlay
- ✅ **Acceptable**: User-controlled algorithmic filtering
- ❌ **Not Acceptable**: Algorithmic ordering as default
- ❌ **Not Acceptable**: Hiding chronological option

#### **Immersion vs. Accessibility**
- ✅ **Acceptable**: Reduced-motion modes that preserve spatial feel
- ✅ **Acceptable**: Accessibility features that don't break immersion
- ✅ **Acceptable**: Alternative navigation methods for accessibility
- ❌ **Not Acceptable**: Removing spatial metaphors for accessibility
- ❌ **Not Acceptable**: Making accessibility break the "place" feeling

### 4. Forbidden Tradeoffs

#### **Never Trade Brand DNA for Engagement**
- ❌ **Forbidden**: Adding infinite scroll to increase time-on-site
- ❌ **Forbidden**: Using metrics to drive behavior
- ❌ **Forbidden**: Algorithmic feeds to increase engagement
- ❌ **Forbidden**: Removing customization for scale

#### **Never Trade Presence for Performance**
- ❌ **Forbidden**: Reducing presence updates for performance
- ❌ **Forbidden**: Caching presence data that becomes stale
- ❌ **Forbidden**: Making presence secondary to metrics

#### **Never Trade User Intent for Algorithms**
- ❌ **Forbidden**: Overriding user intent with algorithms
- ❌ **Forbidden**: Hiding chronological order
- ❌ **Forbidden**: Making algorithmic filtering default

#### **Never Trade Space Metaphor for Efficiency**
- ❌ **Forbidden**: Making UI feel like a tool
- ❌ **Forbidden**: Removing spatial context
- ❌ **Forbidden**: Prioritizing efficiency over immersion

### 5. Conflict Resolution Framework

#### **Safety vs. Immersion**
**Resolution**: Safety always wins, but immersion is preserved where possible
- Age gates can exist, but must feel like doors, not walls
- Content moderation can filter, but must preserve spatial context
- Safety features must integrate with the "place" metaphor

#### **Presence vs. Performance**
**Resolution**: Presence prioritized, but performance optimized within presence constraints
- Presence updates are non-negotiable
- Performance optimization happens around presence, not instead of it
- If performance is poor, optimize infrastructure, not presence features

#### **User Intent vs. Algorithms**
**Resolution**: User intent always wins, algorithms assist only
- Chronological order is default
- Algorithmic suggestions are enhancements, not replacements
- User can always override algorithmic choices

#### **Customization vs. Scale**
**Resolution**: Customization prioritized, scale achieved through infrastructure
- Never remove customization for scale
- Scale through better infrastructure, not feature reduction
- Customization is core to brand DNA, not optional

#### **Immersion vs. Accessibility**
**Resolution**: Both prioritized, accessibility enhances immersion
- Accessibility features must preserve spatial feel
- Reduced-motion modes maintain spatial context
- Alternative navigation methods still feel like movement

### Pre-Feature Checklist

Before any feature ships, answer:

1. ✅ Does it violate any non-negotiable?
2. ✅ Does it align with Brand DNA principles?
3. ✅ Does it feel like a place, not a tool?
4. ✅ Does it prioritize presence over performance?
5. ✅ Does it respect user intent over algorithms?
6. ✅ Does it preserve customization over uniformity?
7. ✅ Does it maintain immersion over scrolling?

### Review Process

1. **Design Review**: Check against Brand DNA
2. **Implementation Review**: Verify non-negotiables
3. **User Testing**: Confirm "place" feeling
4. **Final Approval**: All checks must pass

---

## Brand DNA Reference

Every rule must explicitly reference:

1. **Immersion over scrolling**
2. **Profile as personal space**
3. **Presence over performance**
4. **Anti-algorithm philosophy**
5. **Room / space metaphor**

## Success Criteria

The product rulebook is successful when:

- ✅ Any developer can check a feature against rules
- ✅ Rules prevent feature creep and brand dilution
- ✅ Conflicts between principles are resolvable
- ✅ Rules are enforceable, not aspirational
- ✅ Brand DNA is preserved in every decision
