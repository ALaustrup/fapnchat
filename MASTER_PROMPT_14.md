### 4. How Visitors Experience Someone Else's Space

#### **Visitor Experience Flow**

**Entering a Space**:
1. **Arrival** (visual transition, door opening)
2. **Presence update** ("You entered [User]'s space")
3. **Context shift** (their space becomes active)
4. **Co-presence** (see if they're present, who else is visiting)

**Exploring a Space**:
- **Ambient experience** (background, music, atmosphere)
- **Content exploration** (bio, media, links, widgets)
- **Interaction** (guestbook, reactions, gifts)
- **Presence awareness** (see if owner is present)

**Leaving a Space**:
- **Visual transition** (door closing, space contracting)
- **Presence update** ("You left [User]'s space")
- **Context shift** (return to previous space)
- **Co-presence** (presence removed from space)

#### **Visitor Controls**

**What Visitors Can Do**:
- ✅ View profile content (if public)
- ✅ Leave messages (if enabled)
- ✅ React to profile (if enabled)
- ✅ See presence (if shared)
- ✅ Follow/connect (if enabled)

**What Visitors Cannot Do**:
- ❌ Modify profile (owner only)
- ❌ Remove content (owner only)
- ❌ Change settings (owner only)
- ❌ Access private content (privacy controls)

#### **Privacy Integration**

- **Hidden** (not discoverable, invite-only)

**Privacy Controls**:
- **Who can visit** (public, friends, private, hidden)
- **What's visible** (all, some, minimal)
- **Who can interact** (all, friends, none)
- **Presence visibility** (all, friends, none)

### 5. How Profiles Evolve Over Time

#### **Organic Evolution**

**Natural Changes**:
- **Content updates** (new photos, new thoughts)
- **Style evolution** (tastes change, styles evolve)
- **Interest shifts** (new hobbies, new passions)
- **Connection growth** (new friends, new relationships)

**Not Pressure**:
- ❌ No pressure to "perfect" profile
- ❌ No pressure to maintain consistency
- ❌ No pressure to optimize for metrics
- ❌ No pressure to compete with others

#### **Evolution Tools**

**Update Mechanisms**:
- **Easy editing** (quick updates, not rebuilds)
- **Version history** (see how profile evolved)
- **Snapshots** (save moments in time)

## Brand DNA Alignment

Every customization decision must align with:

1. **Profile as personal space** → Profiles are rooms, not summaries
2. **Presence over performance** → Presence matters more than polish
3. **Immersion over scrolling** → Customization is depth, not breadth
4. **Anti-algorithm philosophy** → Discovery is intentional, not competitive
5. **Room / space metaphor** → Profiles feel like places, not pages

---

## Success Criteria

The customization system is successful when:

- ✅ Profiles feel like personal spaces users inhabit
- ✅ Visitors feel like entering someone's room
- ✅ Creativity is rewarded without competition
- ✅ Customization is deep but safe
- ✅ Expression evolves organically over time
- ✅ No pressure to "perfect" profiles
- ✅ No metrics-driven customization
- ✅ No competitive positioning

---

**CRITICAL**: This customization system must preserve **Profile as personal space** - profiles are rooms users inhabit, not summaries they present. Customization must enable deep personalization while remaining safe for all ages and expressive without chaos.
