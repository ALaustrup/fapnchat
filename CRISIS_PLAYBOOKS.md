# WYA!? — Crisis playbooks

## (what happens when things go wrong)

### Crisis philosophy

**Crises are inevitable.**  
**Damage is optional.**

WYA!? treats crises as:

- Operational events, not PR events
- Moments for clarity, not spin
- Tests of legitimacy

## Crisis classification system

### Level 1 — Minor incident

**Examples:**

- Brief outage
- Visual bugs
- Non-sensitive feature regression

**Response:**

- Acknowledge in status page
- Fix fast
- No user action required

---

### Level 2 — Service disruption

**Examples:**

- Messaging delays
- Presence desync
- Partial region outage

**Response:**

- Public status update
- Estimated resolution
- Postmortem after fix
- No blame language

---

### Level 3 — Safety or moderation incident

**Examples:**

- Moderation mistake
- Abuse slipping through
- Delayed response to reports

**Response:**

- Immediate acknowledgment
- Temporary safeguards
- Human review escalation
- Direct communication to affected users
- Transparent corrective action

**Silence is forbidden at this level.**

---

### Level 4 — Data or security incident

**Examples:**

- Data exposure
- Credential compromise
- Infrastructure breach

**Response timeline:**

- **Hour 0–2:** Containment
- **Hour 2–6:** Internal assessment
- **Hour 6–12:** User notification
- **24–72h:** Full disclosure report
- Ongoing remediation updates

**Users are told what happened, what didn't, and what changes.**

---

### Level 5 — Existential crisis

**Examples:**

- Systemic abuse discovery
- Legal threat to core principles
- Governance failure
- Loss of trust at scale

**Response:**

- Freeze growth
- Enable emergency governance
- Safety council takes lead
- Community briefings
- External audits
- Structural changes, not band-aids

**Survival without legitimacy is failure.**

---

## Crisis communication rules

### We always:

- Speak in plain language
- Avoid corporate phrasing
- Admit uncertainty when present
- Separate facts from speculation
- Update even when nothing changes

### We never:

- Blame users
- Minimize harm
- Hide behind legal language
- Delay disclosure for optics

---

## Incident command structure

During crisis:

- Single incident commander
- Clear chain of responsibility
- Logged decisions
- External observer when appropriate

**No committee paralysis. No rogue actions.**

---

## Post-crisis obligations

Every crisis ends with:

- Public postmortem
- What failed
- What worked
- What changed
- What will never happen again

**If no change occurred, the response failed.**

---

## User restitution principles

When users are harmed:

- Acknowledge harm
- Restore access or content where possible
- Provide support resources
- Compensate when appropriate
- Offer exit without penalty

**Retention is not the goal. Respect is.**

---

## Crisis drills & failure injection

Regularly scheduled:

- Simulated breaches
- Moderation overload drills
- Misinformation scenarios
- Scale failures
- Governance deadlocks

**Failure is practiced so panic doesn't decide outcomes.**

---

## The final crisis rule

If forced to choose between:

- Protecting reputation
- Protecting users

**WYA!? protects users, even if it costs trust short-term.**

**Trust lost by honesty can be rebuilt.**  
**Trust lost by deception cannot.**

---

## Closing synthesis

**Governance prevents drift.**  
**Crisis playbooks prevent collapse.**

Together they ensure WYA!? remains:

- Legitimate
- Humane
- Repairable
- Worth defending
