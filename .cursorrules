# WYA!? — Global System Prompt

You are working on WYA!? — a geo-first, safety-first, expression-driven social platform.

## ALPHA CONSTRAINTS (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

This is ALPHA, not beta or production.

DO NOT add features outside the defined alpha scope.

DO NOT add:
- Monetization (beyond basic premium)
- Video chat
- Stranger chat roulette
- Marketplace
- Advanced boosts
- Custom CSS
- Events
- TURN/SFU infrastructure
- Heavy WebGL effects

## ALPHA SCOPE (IN ONLY)

✅ Accounts & age layers
✅ Geo-first discovery (simplified)
✅ Profiles as rooms (MVP)
✅ 1:1 chat (core magic)
✅ Small group rooms (text-only, 3-10 users)
✅ Basic moderation tools
✅ Observability

## DESIGN PRINCIPLES

Priority: Safety > growth > polish

Core principles:
- Presence over performance
- Conversations as living spaces
- Profiles as rooms, not resumes
- Geo-first discovery
- Age-segmented safety layers

## ANTI-PATTERNS (FORBIDDEN)

Never introduce:
- Infinite feeds
- Engagement bait patterns
- Algorithmic trance states
- Passive consumption patterns
- Endless scrolling
- Metrics as status weapons
- Shadowbanning without explanation
- Dark patterns for growth

## CODE STANDARDS

All code must be:
- Readable — Clear intent, obvious behavior
- Boring — Standard patterns, no clever hacks
- Explicit — No magic, no hidden behavior
- Well-commented — Explain why, not what

Prefer:
- Simplicity over cleverness
- Clarity over optimization
- Correctness over speed
- Explicit over implicit

## DECISION MAKING

- If a feature feels too large: Split into minimal viable version
- If unsure: ASK by leaving TODO comments — do NOT invent behavior
- If refactoring: Explain why in comments

## REFERENCE DOCUMENTS

All decisions must align with:
- PRODUCT_GOVERNANCE.md
- ALPHA_LAUNCH_PLAN.md
- CLIENT_CONTRACT_AND_OFFLINE_FIRST.md
- MODERATION_TOOLING_AND_OPERATOR_EXPERIENCE.md
- LEGAL_AND_ETHICAL_INVARIANTS.md
- GOVERNANCE_AND_COMMUNITY_COOWNERSHIP.md
- CRISIS_PLAYBOOKS.md
- ALPHA_SCHEMA_LOCK.md

## ENFORCEMENT

This applies to ALL code changes and decisions.

When in doubt:
1. Check Alpha scope first
2. Check anti-patterns second
3. Check reference documents third
4. Ask, don't assume

Remember: WYA!? is about perfecting the foundation, not shipping everything. Discipline, not imagination.
