# WYA!? — Legal & ethical invariants

## (what we will never do)

### Purpose of this document

**This is not marketing language.**  
**This is a binding internal doctrine.**

If breaking one of these would increase growth, revenue, or safety optics, we still do not break it.

**These are the conditions under which WYA!? deserves to exist.**

---

## 1. Data ownership invariants

We will never:

- Sell user data, profiles, or behavioral exhaust
- License user data to advertisers, data brokers, or partners
- Train third-party models on private user content
- Retain deleted user data beyond legal minimums
- Use "anonymized" data to re-identify users

**User data exists to serve the user, not the company.**

---

## 2. Surveillance invariants

We will never:

- Track users across the web
- Use fingerprinting techniques to bypass consent
- Collect precise location without explicit opt-in
- Monitor private conversations for monetization
- Record audio or video without active user intent

**If we wouldn't want it done to us, we don't do it.**

---

## 3. Algorithmic manipulation invariants

We will never:

- Shadowban users without explanation
- Secretly throttle reach to coerce payment
- Optimize feeds for addiction, outrage, or despair
- Hide ranking logic from users
- Run behavioral experiments without disclosure

**WYA!? rejects dark patterns as a growth strategy.**

---

## 4. Age & safety invariants

We will never:

- Allow minors and adults to interact in shared spaces
- Expose minors to adult content, even indirectly
- Monetize minors' attention
- Incentivize risky behavior for engagement
- Silence safety reports to protect optics

**Safety is structural, not performative.**

---

## 5. Moderation ethics invariants

We will never:

- Issue irreversible punishments without appeal
- Allow moderators to act anonymously or unaccountably
- Punish users for lawful self-expression
- Use automation as final authority
- Enforce rules inconsistently for "important" users

**Power is always constrained, logged, and reviewable.**

---

## 6. Monetization ethics invariants

We will never:

- Gate core social interaction behind payment
- Sell boosts that guarantee outcomes
- Design scarcity to exploit fear or loneliness
- Hide pricing, fees, or subscription traps
- Punish non-paying users through degradation

**Money enhances expression, never access to humanity.**

---

## 7. Legal compliance boundaries

We will always:

- Comply with child safety laws across jurisdictions
- Respect data deletion and portability rights
- Honor lawful requests with transparency
- Publish transparency reports regularly

But we will never:

- Voluntarily expand surveillance beyond legal necessity
- Create backdoors or secret access
- Cooperate with unlawful data requests

**Compliance does not mean obedience without ethics.**

---

## 8. Platform integrity invariants

We will never:

- Artificially inflate metrics
- Fake activity or presence
- Manufacture social proof
- Suppress whistleblowers
- Lie to users about outages or failures

**Trust compounds. Deception collapses everything.**

---

## 9. Exit & portability invariants

We will never:

- Lock users in through friction
- Sabotage exports
- Hold data hostage
- Punish users for leaving

**Leaving WYA!? should be as respectful as joining.**

---

## 10. The final invariant

If WYA!? must choose between:

- Growth and dignity
- Profit and safety
- Control and trust

**We choose dignity, safety, and trust.**

**If that makes WYA!? smaller, it makes it worth building.**
