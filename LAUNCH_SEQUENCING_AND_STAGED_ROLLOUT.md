# WYA!? — Launch sequencing & staged public rollout

## Core launch philosophy

**WYA!? is not launched.**  
**It is introduced.**

**We scale culture before scale infrastructure.**

**Goal:** Prevent value drift before exposure.

### Actions:

- Lock ethical invariants (above)
- Freeze safety architecture
- Finalize age-layer enforcement
- Internal threat modeling
- Operator tooling readiness

**No press. No hype. No leaks.**

### Characteristics:

### Explicitly avoided:

- Paid user acquisition
- Engagement bait
- Shock marketing

**Growth follows meaning, not the reverse.**

## Phase 6 — Scale & governance maturation

At scale:

- Publish transparency reports
- Introduce community councils
- Expand operator teams
- Open policy feedback loops

**Governance evolves with users, not against them.**

---

## Failure posture during launch

Failures will happen.

**WYA!? response to failure:**

- Acknowledge immediately
- Explain clearly
- Fix visibly
- Learn publicly

**Silence is treated as harm.**

---

## Launch success criteria (non-metric)

Launch is successful if:

- Users describe WYA!? as "a place"
- Conversations feel alive
- Moderation feels fair
- Creators feel respected
- Leaving users still trust us

**If numbers are high but trust is low, launch failed.**

---

## Final synthesis

These two documents are the spine of WYA!?.

**One defines what power can never do.**  
**The other defines how growth must behave.**

Together they prevent:

- Enshittification
- Moral drift
- Panic-driven decisions
- Platform betrayal
